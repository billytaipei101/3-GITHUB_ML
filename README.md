Book Title = Artificial Networks and Machine Learning

This is an unfolding Self-study book on Neural Networks and Machine Learning using LATEX; for
the implementation of the code MATLAB software is required. The document with MATLAB extension (.m) only contains the parts 
of the code being addressed within the book. The file with .pdf extension is the latest updated render of the book
which contains basic theory, equations, figures and examples, being fully and completely cross referenced.
This file is the output after building the .tex file with pdflatex, using the Wiley Book style template available from the website below
