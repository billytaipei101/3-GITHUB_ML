Book Title = Artificial Networks and Machine Learning

This is an unfolding Self-study book on Neural Networks and Machine Learning using LATEX; for
the implementation of the code I use MATLAB software. The document with MATLAB extension (.m) only contains the parts of the 
code being addressed in the the book. The PDF is the latest updated render of the book which contains basic theory, equations,
figures and examples, being fully and completely cross referenced along the content; it consist of the output after building
the .tex file with pdflatex, using the Wiley Book style template available from the website below
